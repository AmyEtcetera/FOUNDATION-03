You can add data without a full database by using json or yml for formatting it, and injecting it into Handlebars.

Partials are used, and by the way, you don't have to use a file extension b/c .html is expected, but you can also use .hbs, which is Handlebars!

In the data folder, you can add .json or .yml files, (and also .md ), to inject data into partials.

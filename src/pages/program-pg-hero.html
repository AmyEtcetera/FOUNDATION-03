re <section>
  A region landmark is a perceivable section of the page containing content that is sufficiently important for users to be able to navigate to the section.
  A region landmark must have a label.
  If a page includes more than one region landmark, each should have a unique label

    Use the HTML5 section element to define a region landmark.
    If the HTML5 section element technique is not being used, use a role="region" attribute to define a region landmark.

    Each region landmark should have a heading h2-h6 element identifying the content of the landmark.
    If there are more than one region landmark on the page, use aria-labelledby to reference the heading element for labeling each landmark.

		<aside class="callout" role="complementary"><!-- A complementary landmark is a supporting section of the document, designed to be complementary to the main content at a similar level in the DOM hierarchy, but remains meaningful when separated from the main content.
      If a page includes more than one complementary landmark, each should have a unique label.

    Use the HTML5 aside element to define a complementary landmark.
    If the HTML5 aside element technique is not being used, use a role="complementary" attribute to define a complementary landmark.

    Each complementary landmark should have an h2 element identifying the content of the landmark.
    If there are more than one complementary landmark on the page, use aria-labelledby to reference the h2 elements for labeling each landmark.
